# Velocentrax_MV_099

This project builds a fully integrated omni-channel analytics framework to measure how promotional activities influence healthcare provider (HCP) prescribing behavior and territory performance.

The system combines multiple promotional channels into a unified analytical layer and generates insights for:

  1. Commercial strategy teams

  2. National business leadership

  3. Field force optimization

  4. Marketing performance measurement


🎯 Business Objectives

  1. Understand which promotional channels drive prescription growth

  2. Measure HCP engagement depth vs Rx outcomes

  3. Identify high-value HCPs and HCOs

  4. Optimize territory-level commercial strategy

  5. Build data-driven decision support for leadership****
